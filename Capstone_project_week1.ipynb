Once done, we will get online ratings for each hotel - this will help us to choose 5 best hotels in Warsaw. Once hotels are chosen, we will find nearby venues in the range of 1km from the hotel. The best hotel would be with highest online rating + with highest number of venues in a neighbourhood. All this data will be obtained using Foursquare API\n",
